# Python API Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to a Python API Challenge that involves two main projects: `WeatherPy` and `VacationPy`. These projects demonstrate how to interact with APIs, handle data, and visualize information using Python.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following directories and files:
- `Starter_Code/`: Initial starter code provided for the challenge.
- `WeatherPy/`: Contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing weather data.
- `VacationPy/`: Contains scripts and notebooks for planning vacations based on weather data.
- `utils/`: Utility functions to support the main projects.
- `output_data/`: Directory for storing output data and visualizations generated by the projects.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Projects

### WeatherPy
WeatherPy is focused on analyzing weather data from various cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API. The tasks include:
- Generating a list of cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Collecting weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness.
- Creating scatter plots to visualize the relationships between different weather parameters.

### VacationPy
VacationPy extends the analysis from WeatherPy to help plan vacations. This project includes:
- Using the weather data to identify ideal vacation spots based on preferred weather conditions.
- Utilizing the Google Maps API to find hotels near the identified vacation spots.
- Visualizing the vacation spots on a map with hotel information.

## Utilities
The `utils` folder contains helper functions to facilitate API requests and data handling.

### Key Functions
- **api_requests.py**: Contains functions for making API requests.
  - `make_api_request(url, params)`: Makes a GET request to the specified URL with given parameters.
  - `load_config(file_path)`: Loads configuration settings from a JSON file.

## Output Data
The `output_data` directory is used to store the results generated by the projects. This includes:
- CSV files with collected weather data.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots and maps.
- Any other output files generated during the analysis.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jhammans/python-api-challenge.git
    cd python-api-challenge
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Obtain API keys:
    - OpenWeatherMap API Key
    - Geoapify API Key

5. Create a `config.py` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
    ```python
    weather_api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    geoapify_key = "YOUR_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY"
    ```

## Usage

### Running WeatherPy
1. Navigate to the `WeatherPy` directory:
    ```sh
    cd WeatherPy
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook WeatherPy.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and generate the analysis and visualizations.

### Running VacationPy
1. Navigate to the `VacationPy` directory:
    ```sh
    cd VacationPy
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook VacationPy.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and plan your ideal vacation.
